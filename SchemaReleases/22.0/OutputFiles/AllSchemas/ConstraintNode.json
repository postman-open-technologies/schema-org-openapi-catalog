{"$schema":"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema","title":"ConstraintNode","description":"The ConstraintNode type is provided to support usecases in which a node in a structured data graph is described with properties which appear to describe a single entity, but are being used in a situation where they serve a more abstract purpose. A [[ConstraintNode]] can be described using [[constraintProperty]] and [[numConstraints]]. These constraint properties can serve a \n    variety of purposes, and their values may sometimes be understood to indicate sets of possible values rather than single, exact and specific values.","allOf":[{"super":"schema:Intangible"}],"type":"object","properties":{"constraintProperty":{"description":"Indicates a property used as a constraint. For example, in the definition of a [[StatisticalVariable]]. The value is a property, either from within Schema.org or from other compatible (e.g. RDF) systems such as DataCommons.org or Wikidata.org. ","oneOf":[{"schemaType":"schema:URL"},{"schemaType":"schema:Property"}]},"numConstraints":{"description":"Indicates the number of constraints property values defined for a particular [[ConstraintNode]] such as [[StatisticalVariable]]. This helps applications understand if they have access to a sufficiently complete description of a [[StatisticalVariable]] or other construct that is defined using properties on template-style nodes.","type":"integer"}}}
