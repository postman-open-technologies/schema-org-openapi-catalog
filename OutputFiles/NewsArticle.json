For location depicted or described in the content, use [[contentLocation]].\n\nDateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples: \"BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.\", \"Paris, France\", \"December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington\", \"Beijing/Moscow\", \"QUEZON CITY, Philippines\".\n      ","type":"string"},"printPage":{"description":"If this NewsArticle appears in print, this field indicates the name of the page on which the article is found.
