{"$schema":"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema","$id":"https://schema.org/CriticReview.json","title":"CriticReview","description":"A [[CriticReview]] is a more specialized form of Review written or published by a source that is recognized for its reviewing activities. These can include online columns, travel and food guides, TV and radio shows, blogs and other independent Web sites. [[CriticReview]]s are typically more in-depth and professionally written. For simpler, casually written user/visitor/viewer/customer reviews, it is more appropriate to use the [[UserReview]] type. Review aggregator sites such as Metacritic already separate out the site's user reviews from selected critic reviews that originate from third-party sources.","allOf":[{"super":"schema:Review"}],"type":"object","properties":{}}
