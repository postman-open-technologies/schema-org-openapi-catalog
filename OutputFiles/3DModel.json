For the\ncase of a single file published after Zip compression, the convention of appending '+zip' to the [[encodingFormat]] can be used. Geospatial, AR/VR, artistic/animation, gaming, engineering and scientific content can all be represented using [[3DModel]].","allOf":[{"$ref":"schema:MediaObject.json"}],"type":"object","properties":{"isResizable":{"description":"Whether the 3DModel allows resizing.
