GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.\n\nThe GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also [schema.org tracking issue](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3156#issuecomment-1209522809) for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a \"GS1 Digital Link\" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also [GS1's GTIN Summary](http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number) for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The [[gtin]] property generalizes the earlier [[gtin8]], [[gtin12]], [[gtin13]], and [[gtin14]] properties.\n\nNote also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.","oneOf":[{"type":"string"}]},"deliveryLeadTime":{"description":"The typical delay between the receipt of the order and the goods either leaving the warehouse or being prepared for pickup, in case the delivery method is on site pickup."},"advanceBookingRequirement":{"description":"The amount of time that is required between accepting the offer and the actual usage of the resource or service."},"mpn":{"description":"The Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) of the product, or the product to which the offer refers.","type":"string"},"areaServed":{"description":"The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided.","oneOf":[{"type":"string"}]},"inventoryLevel":{"description":"The current approximate inventory level for the item or items."},"serialNumber":{"description":"The serial number or any alphanumeric identifier of a particular product.
