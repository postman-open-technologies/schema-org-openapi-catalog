The general trend in web technology is towards [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established [[url]] property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all [[url]] markup to use [[mobileUrl]] for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional \"mobile site\" alongside the main one.

For other kinds of [[CreativeWork]] it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as [[contentLocation]] and [[locationCreated]] may be more applicable.\n\nIn the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here."},"keywords":{"description":"Keywords or tags used to describe some item.

It is safe to infer that the variant inherits all product features from the base model, unless defined locally. This is not transitive. In the case of a [[ProductGroup]], the group description also serves as a template, representing a set of Products that vary on explicitly defined, specific dimensions only (so it defines both a set of variants, as well as which values distinguish amongst those variants).

GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.\n\nThe GS1 [digital link specifications](https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/) express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also [schema.org tracking issue](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3156#issuecomment-1209522809) for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct [[gtin]] value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a \"GS1 Digital Link\" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs.
