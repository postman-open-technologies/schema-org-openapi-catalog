## Pull Request Process

Upon approval your PR will be merged into develop for further verification and then merged into production upon final approval. Please delete your branch once it's been merged to develop to help keep a clean repository.

> __Repo Collaborators__: Please only push to `develop` when changes are ready to publish. The `develop` branch is intended only as a last check to see edits live on the web in a production type build environment before publishingâ€”changes shouldn't sit on the `develop` branch for long before pushing to `master`.


## Running checks locally

Before creating a PR we STRONGLY recommend to running the following test locally to check that all changes will pass our linters:

* `npm run test`  -> runs the Unit testing
* `npm run test:lint` -> runs the ESlinter
* `npm run test:url` -> checks if acceptable image URL has been added
* `npm run test:update` -> updates the test snapshots
* `npm run dev` -> runs a server on http://localhost:8000/ so you can view changes locally
